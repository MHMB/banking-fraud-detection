# Scenario 06: Trade-Based Money Laundering

## Overview

**Pattern:** Over/under-invoicing in international trade

This scenario demonstrates trade-based money laundering where the value transferred between parties is misrepresented through false invoicing, allowing funds to move across borders under the guise of legitimate trade.

**Account Characteristics:**
- Company A (Iran importer - "Tehran Trading Co")
- Company B (UAE exporter - "Gulf Trading LLC")
- Company C (intermediary in free zone)
- Company D (another shell company)

**Fraudulent Transaction Flow:**
- Trade transaction: Import goods from B
- Invoice shows: 1M USD equivalent
- Actual value: 200K USD (80% over-invoicing)
- Payment route: A → C → B (through free zone)
- C charges 15% commission (150K USD)
- Multiple similar transactions over 3 months
- Documents show electronics imports (inflated values)

**Fraud Indicators:**
- Trade invoices significantly inflated
- Routing through free zone/intermediaries
- Value transfer through trade misrepresentation
- Shell companies in free trade zones involved
- Multiple high-value similar transactions


## Transaction Statistics
- **Total Transactions:** ~90
- **Fraudulent Transactions:** ~30
- **Legitimate Transactions:** ~60

## Data Fields

### transactions.csv Columns
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| transaction_id | Unique transaction reference |
| date | Transaction date (Solar Hijri YYYYMMDD) |
| time | Transaction time (HHMMSS) |
| sender_sheba | Originating account Sheba number |
| receiver_sheba | Receiving account Sheba number |
| amount | Amount in IRR (Iranian Rial) |

## Usage Examples

### Load Transactions in Python
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load transactions
df = pd.read_csv('transactions.csv', encoding='utf-8-sig')

# Convert amount to millions
df['amount_millions'] = df['amount'] / 1_000_000

# Filter fraudulent patterns
high_value = df[df['amount'] > 100_000_000]
rapid_transfers = df[df.duplicated(subset=['sender_sheba'], keep=False)]
```

### Analyze Account Relationships
```python
# Find accounts with unusual activity
account_activity = df.groupby('sender_sheba').agg({
    'amount': ['sum', 'count', 'mean'],
    'date': ['min', 'max']
})

# Identify circular flows
circular_pairs = df[df.apply(
    lambda x: x['receiver_sheba'] in df['sender_sheba'].values,
    axis=1
)]
```

## Detection Strategies

### Key Risk Indicators to Look For:
1. **Velocity Checks:** Unusual transaction frequency or speed
2. **Amount Patterns:** Round numbers, threshold avoidance
3. **Relationship Anomalies:** New beneficiaries, unusual connections
4. **Temporal Patterns:** Unusual timing, rapid sequences
5. **Cross-Account Analysis:** Shared identifiers (IP, device, phone)

### Red Flags Specific to This Scenario:
- Review the fraud indicators listed in the overview section
- Cross-reference with accounts_master.csv for customer details
- Look for deviations from established baseline behavior
- Identify clustering patterns in time, amount, or geography
