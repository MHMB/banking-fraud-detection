# Scenario 01: Simple Layering (Money Laundering)

## Overview

**Pattern:** cash in → A → B → C → D → cash out, repeated 3 times

Cash is placed just below the reporting threshold into a recently opened account and
pushed through three more individual accounts within ~4 days, losing 0.5M per hop,
then withdrawn in cash.

**Planted (roles in ground_truth.csv):**
- `placement`: cash deposits of 45M, 48.5M, 42M into A (branch, early morning)
- `layering`: A→B→C→D, one hop per business day, −0.5M per hop
- `integration`: D withdraws the amount minus 5M in cash

**How it is hidden:**
- Legitimate cash deposits and salaries of similar size (up to ~49.5M)
- A, B, C, D also send/receive ordinary payments
- Neutral or empty descriptions

**Indicators:** sub-threshold cash followed by fast pass-through; decreasing amounts; new first account.


## Transaction Statistics
- **Total Transactions:** 135
- **Planted Fraud Transactions:** 15
- **Background (legitimate) Transactions:** 120
- **Period:** 14030101 – 14030204

## Usage Examples

### Load Transactions in Python
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load transactions
df = pd.read_csv('transactions.csv', encoding='utf-8-sig')

# Convert amount to millions
df['amount_millions'] = df['amount'] / 1_000_000

# Score a detector against the planted labels
truth = pd.read_csv('ground_truth.csv', encoding='utf-8-sig')
df['is_planted'] = df['transaction_id'].isin(truth['transaction_id'])
```

### Analyze Account Relationships
```python
# Find accounts with unusual activity
account_activity = df.groupby('sender_sheba').agg({
    'amount': ['sum', 'count', 'mean'],
    'date': ['min', 'max']
})

# Identify circular flows
circular_pairs = df[df.apply(
    lambda x: x['receiver_sheba'] in df['sender_sheba'].values,
    axis=1
)]
```

## Detection Strategies

### Key Risk Indicators to Look For:
1. **Velocity Checks:** Unusual transaction frequency or speed
2. **Amount Patterns:** Round numbers, threshold avoidance
3. **Relationship Anomalies:** New beneficiaries, unusual connections
4. **Temporal Patterns:** Unusual timing, rapid sequences
5. **Cross-Account Analysis:** Shared branch, shared beneficiaries, account age

### Red Flags Specific to This Scenario:
- Review the fraud indicators listed in the overview section
- Cross-reference with accounts_master.csv for customer details
- Look for deviations from established baseline behavior
- Identify clustering patterns in time, amount, or geography
