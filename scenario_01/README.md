# Scenario 01: Simple Layering (Money Laundering)

## Overview

**Pattern:** Customer A → B → C → D in quick succession

This scenario demonstrates a classic layering technique where illicit funds are moved through multiple accounts in rapid succession to obscure their origin. Each layer extracts a commission, gradually reducing the amount.

**Account Characteristics:**
- 4 individual accounts (all active)
- Shared attributes: same phone number or IP address
- Customer A: New account (opened recently)
- Customers B, C, D: Established accounts

**Fraudulent Transaction Flow:**
- Day 1: A deposits 45M IRR (cash at branch)
- Day 1: A → B transfer 44.5M (online banking)
- Day 2: B → C transfer 44M (mobile)
- Day 3: C → D transfer 43.5M (online)
- Day 4: D withdraws 40M (cash at branch)

**Fraud Indicators:**
- Rapid movement through multiple accounts (3 days)
- Gradual decrease (commission extraction at each layer)
- All accounts share contact information
- Unusual pattern for customer D (normally low activity)


## Transaction Statistics
- **Total Transactions:** ~80
- **Fraudulent Transactions:** ~15
- **Legitimate Transactions:** ~65

## Data Fields

### transactions.csv Columns
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| transaction_id | Unique transaction reference |
| date | Transaction date (Solar Hijri YYYYMMDD) |
| time | Transaction time (HHMMSS) |
| sender_sheba | Originating account Sheba number |
| receiver_sheba | Receiving account Sheba number |
| amount | Amount in IRR (Iranian Rial) |
| currency | Currency code (IRR, USD, EUR) |
| type | Transfer type (برداشت/Withdrawal, واریزت/Transfer, واریت واریزت/Wire) |
| description | Transaction description/narrative |
| reference | Bank reference number |
| channel | Transaction channel (شبکه/Online, شعبه/Branch, ATM, موبایل/Mobile) |
| status | Transaction status (completed, pending, failed, rejected) |

## Usage Examples

### Load Transactions in Python
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load transactions
df = pd.read_csv('transactions.csv', encoding='utf-8-sig')

# Convert amount to millions
df['amount_millions'] = df['amount'] / 1_000_000

# Filter fraudulent patterns
high_value = df[df['amount'] > 100_000_000]
rapid_transfers = df[df.duplicated(subset=['sender_sheba'], keep=False)]
```

### Analyze Account Relationships
```python
# Find accounts with unusual activity
account_activity = df.groupby('sender_sheba').agg({
    'amount': ['sum', 'count', 'mean'],
    'date': ['min', 'max']
})

# Identify circular flows
circular_pairs = df[df.apply(
    lambda x: x['receiver_sheba'] in df['sender_sheba'].values,
    axis=1
)]
```

## Detection Strategies

### Key Risk Indicators to Look For:
1. **Velocity Checks:** Unusual transaction frequency or speed
2. **Amount Patterns:** Round numbers, threshold avoidance
3. **Relationship Anomalies:** New beneficiaries, unusual connections
4. **Temporal Patterns:** Unusual timing, rapid sequences
5. **Cross-Account Analysis:** Shared identifiers (IP, device, phone)

### Red Flags Specific to This Scenario:
- Review the fraud indicators listed in the overview section
- Cross-reference with accounts_master.csv for customer details
- Look for deviations from established baseline behavior
- Identify clustering patterns in time, amount, or geography
